    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><font size="5">Truthfully, I am a pizza lover to my core and this Protein Pizza really hits the spot! I don’t think there is one right way to have pizza (although I’m sure many would argue with me on that). I love thin crust, deep dish, thick crust, and cauliflower. Really, I’m in it for the sauce and toppings so deliver that on whatever you want and I’ll be happy.</font></p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
        <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon yeast this is for flavor only</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fat free greek yogurt plain</li>
        <li>1/2 cup self rising flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 chicken sausage cooked</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fat-free cheddar (kraft makes one)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoon fat free feta</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>sliced onion, spinach, broccoli, mushrooms, or veggies of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat oven to 475° with a sheet pan in the oven. Make sure the rack is centered in the oven.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mix flour, yeast, and greek yogurt together and stir until you get a shaggy dough. Work with your hands until you get a dough ball and there are no more bits of dry flour. I knead in the bowl for about 2-3 minutes</li>
        <br>
        <li>Shape dough into a ball and place on a oil (sprayed) square of parchment paper. Using another piece of oiled parchment paper on top, flatten and roll out using a rolling pin or bottle until it is about 1/4 thick. Remove top parchment paper. Total pizza size should be around 8" in diameter</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add toppings, transfer pizza to pre-heated sheet pan (leave on the parchment paper).</li>
        <br>
        <li>If you have a pizza paddle or another sheet pan, use that to transfer the pizza with parchment paper to the pre-heated pan. If not, you can remove the pre-heated sheet pan, transfer the pizza onto it, and then put it back in the oven. If using another sheet pan, just use it upside down to transfer so the pizza can slide right off!</li>
        <br>
        <li>Turn oven down to 450° and bake for 8 minutes. The top will be browning and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
